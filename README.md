# Individual website: Fantasy Football Scheduler
by Geoff Schaeffer
This application allows someone to schedule a fantasy football league.
(Currently, it only works with a 14-team league playing a 13-week season.)

This app relies heavily on code and examples from Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails tutorial.

It also uses the DLX implementation in Ruby from: https://github.com/biilmann/Ruby-DLX-Sudoku-Solver
